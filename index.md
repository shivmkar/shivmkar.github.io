Legal Professional |Ex-Legasis| Skilled in Compliance & Tax Law | Seeking Progressive Legal Role


Hello there! I am Shivani. I have a LLM in international tax law from Uppsala University. My interests are compliance and tax law. However, I would love to talk about all the general aspects of law to learn and grow!

I am a legal professional with a Masters in International Tax Law and experience in legal and regulatory compliance. Throughout my career, I have developed a strong understanding of complex tax and regulatory frameworks across different countries and industries.

In my previous roles, I have gained experience in advising clients on a wide range of legal and regulatory compliance matters, including risk assessments, due diligence, and policy development. 

I am currently seeking a new opportunity to apply my skills and expertise in a dynamic and challenging environment. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest developments in tax law and regulatory compliance and am committed to delivering high-quality legal services to clients.

Please feel free to connect with me to discuss potential opportunities or to simply network and share insights in our industry. Addtionally, you can also follow me on Medium: https://medium.com/desi-law
